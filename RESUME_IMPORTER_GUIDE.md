3. **Try text paste method** - Copy text manually and use paste method
4. **Check file size** - Very large files may timeout
5. **Convert format** - Try saving as .txt or .docx if having issues

### If components aren't detected:
1. **Check section headers** - Use standard headers like "EXPERIENCE", "SKILLS", "EDUCATION"
2. **Format consistently** - Use clear formatting with line breaks between sections
3. **Review extracted text** - Check if text was extracted correctly from file
